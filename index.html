      <p>
        Ji Yoon Bae is a PhD candidate in Architecture at the Weitzman School of Design, University of Pennsylvania.
        His research on Homeostatic Architecture integrates architectural design with biology, material science, and
        thermodynamics to develop and evaluate environmentally responsive building systems. He investigates
        biologically informed and performance-driven architectural components that create feedback loops between
        humans, buildings, and their surrounding environment, with the goal of promoting biological and ecological
        homeostasis in contemporary socio-climate contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        His interdisciplinary work focuses on passive architectural systems informed by sustainable materials and
        advanced digital technologies, examining how these components can adaptively improve environmental
        performance. Prior to joining the University of Pennsylvania, Ji Yoon received an MS in Matter Design
        Computation from Cornell University and an M.Arch from Syracuse University.
